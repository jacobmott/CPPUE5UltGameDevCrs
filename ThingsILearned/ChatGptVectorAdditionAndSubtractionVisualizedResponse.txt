In a 3D video game, vector addition can be visualized by considering the movement of objects in three-dimensional space. Here's an example to help illustrate the concept:

Let's say you have a game character located at position (x, y, z) in the game world, and you want to move them in a specific direction with a certain velocity. The position vector represents the character's current position, while the velocity vector represents the character's movement direction and speed.

To visualize vector addition in this scenario, imagine that the character is standing at their current position, represented by a point in 3D space. The position vector from the origin to the character's position determines their starting point.

Now, consider the velocity vector, which specifies the direction and magnitude of the character's movement. It extends from the character's current position in the direction of movement. Visualize this vector as an arrow originating from the character's position and pointing in the direction of motion.

To perform vector addition, you take the position vector and add the velocity vector to it. This operation combines the two vectors to determine the character's new position. To visualize this, you extend the velocity vector from the character's position and place the arrowhead at the endpoint of the position vector. The resulting vector, which starts at the origin and reaches the arrowhead, represents the character's new position after the movement.

By repeatedly performing vector addition over time and updating the position vector, you can visualize the character's continuous movement through the game world in 3D space.

It's important to note that in a 3D environment, you would typically work with three-dimensional vectors (x, y, z) for position and velocity. The same principles of vector addition apply, but the vectors would be represented in three-dimensional space rather than just two dimensions as described in this example.

Vector subtraction in a 3D video game is used to determine the relative displacement or difference between two points or objects in three-dimensional space. It is often employed for various purposes such as calculating distances, determining movement directions, or implementing collision detection. Here's how vector subtraction works in a 3D video game:

    Representation: Each point or object in 3D space is represented by a position vector that consists of three components: (x, y, z). These components indicate the coordinates of the point along the x, y, and z axes.

    Subtracting Vectors: To perform vector subtraction, you subtract the corresponding components of the position vectors. Given two position vectors, v1 = (x1, y1, z1) and v2 = (x2, y2, z2), the subtraction is done as follows:

    v3 = v1 - v2 = (x1 - x2, y1 - y2, z1 - z2)

    The resulting vector, v3, represents the displacement or difference between the two points or objects.

    Visualization: To visualize vector subtraction, imagine two points or objects in 3D space. Place the first point at coordinates (x1, y1, z1) and the second point at coordinates (x2, y2, z2). The vector v3 represents the displacement from the second point to the first point.

    You can visualize v3 as an arrow starting at the second point and pointing towards the first point. The arrow's length and direction illustrate the magnitude and direction of the displacement between the two points.

In a video game, vector subtraction can be utilized for various purposes, such as determining the direction and distance between objects, implementing AI navigation, or calculating relative velocities during collisions. It provides valuable information for positioning and spatial calculations in a 3D game environment.
